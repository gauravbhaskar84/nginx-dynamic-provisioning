### nginx-dynamic-provisioning

This repository is to Test - Host-Based & Path-Based routing using Nginx Controller.

There are 2 deployments, 2 Services, 2 Different Ingress Resources - Host-Based Routing and Path Based Routing.

Apart from that this cluster has been running latest k8s version 1.18, along with MetalLB - to take care of LoadBalancer Service.

This cluster also has NFS Dynamic Provisioner installed (thought it is not required for the testing).
